Installation guide for Rad Upload Lite, Rad Upload and Rad Upload Plus.
=======================================================================

First make sure that your server is correctly configured to accept file
uploads. With sites that use PHP you can make use of the included 
test.html and upload.php files to test your server configuration.

Depending on the version you have downloaded move dnd.jar, dndlite.jar
or dndplus.jar onto your web space. Also move the included php files 
onto the same location as the jar file. Next open applet.php in your
favourite text editor and change the 'url' parameter to match your 
server-side upload handler. That's it!

The upload.php is a sample PHP script provided to get you started on 
drag and drop file upload. You may need to modify upload.php to suite
the needs of your website or web application. 

If you prefer to use perl as your server side handler please copy 
upload.cgi to your /cgi-bin/ directory and change permissions to 755.
Perl upload handling can be tested with test-perl.html

Each licence of Rad Upload Lite, Rad Upload and Rad Upload Plus allows
you to install the applet on exactly one website.

Foot Note:
	If you do not make use of PHP on your website, use applet.html
	or applet-js.html instead of applet.php.
